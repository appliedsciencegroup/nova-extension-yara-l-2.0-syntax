ðŸ‘‹ Hello! As Nova users browse the extensions library, a good README can help them understand what your extension does, how it works, and what setup or configuration it may require.

Not every extension will need every item described below. Use your best judgement when deciding which parts to keep to provide the best experience for your new users.

ðŸ’¡ Quick Tip!Â As you edit this README template, you can preview your changes by selecting **Extensions â†’ Activate Project as Extension**, opening the Extension Library, and selecting "YaraL" in the sidebar.

Let's get started!

<!--
ðŸŽˆ Include a brief description of the features your syntax extension provides. For example:
-->

**YaraL** provides syntax highlighting and autocompletion for YARA-L 2.0. This is a computer language used to create rules for searching through your enterprise log data as it is ingested into your Chronicle account. The YARA-L syntax is derived from the YARA language developed by VirusTotal. The language works in conjunction with the Chronicle Detection Engine and enables you to hunt for threats and other events across large volumes of data. See also [YARA-L 2.0 language syntax](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/detection/yara-l-2-0-overview)
